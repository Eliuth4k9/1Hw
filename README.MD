Homework for week one of class.
This wil be my first README.MD and Repo created in Github.
After carefully looking at the requirements for the assignment for week one. I cleaned up some of the HTML code that didn't seem necessary and utilized new classes to consolidate some of the repetitive code in CSS.As well as fix the link that was broken and made sure that each image had an alternate description for accessibility.
